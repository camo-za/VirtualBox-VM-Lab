📘 VirtualBox VM Lab – Windows Client & Server Administration

This project showcases the full setup, configuration, and administration of a Windows 10/11 client environment and a Windows Server 2022 Active Directory domain, all built using Oracle VirtualBox.

It forms part of my CompTIA A+ certification study, my hands-on technical development, and my journey toward an IT Support / Junior SysAdmin role.

🧩 Project Overview

This lab simulates real-world IT Support and System Administration tasks in a controlled virtual environment.
It covers:

Operating system installation (Windows client & server)

Virtual hardware configuration

System configuration & user management

Networking & DNS

Active Directory Domain Services

Group Policy management

System maintenance & snapshots

Troubleshooting and admin tools

All work is documented with screenshots and organised into clearly structured sections.

🖥️ Virtual Machines Created
🪟 Windows Client VM – Windows 10 & Windows 11

The project began with a Windows 10 VM (Sections 0–3) and was later rebuilt on Windows 11 (Sections 4–7) due to performance improvements and updated tools.

All tasks were aligned with CompTIA A+ and entry-level SysAdmin objectives.

Windows 10 (Sections 0–3)

Installed from Windows 10 Evaluation ISO

Configured restore point and local user accounts

Practised file system and permissions tasks

Compared Control Panel vs Settings

Explored system tools and administrative utilities

Windows 11 (Sections 4–7)

Installed from clean Windows 11 Evaluation ISO

Practised core networking commands
(ipconfig, ping, tracert, nslookup)

Used Task Manager, Services, Event Viewer & MSConfig

System tools: Windows Update, restore points, File History, Firewall, Defender, UAC

Explored security basics and administrative controls
