# 💻 VirtualBox VM Lab  

This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of both **Windows 10/11** and **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** virtual machines using **Oracle VirtualBox**.  

It serves as part of my **CompTIA A+ certification study** and my journey toward an **IT Support / SysAdmin** role.  

---

## 🧾 Project Overview  

This lab was designed to simulate real-world IT Support and System Administration tasks in a safe, virtual environment.  

It covers installation, configuration, snapshot management, and system-level troubleshooting across multiple operating systems.

## 🧩 Virtual Machines Created  

### 🪟 Windows VM  

> The Windows lab began on **Windows 10 (Sections 0 – 3)** and was later rebuilt on **Windows 11 (Sections 4 – 7)** due to performance issues on the initial VM.  
>  
> All tasks and screenshots remain aligned with CompTIA A+ and entry-level SysAdmin objectives.

#### 🔹 Windows 10 – (Sections 0 – 3)
- Installed from Windows 10 Evaluation ISO  
- Configured system restore point and local user accounts  
- Practised file system and permissions tasks  
- Compared **Control Panel** vs **Settings** interfaces  

#### 🔹 Windows 11 – (Sections 4 – 7)
- Continued lab work on a clean Windows 11 VM build  
- Practised core networking commands (`ipconfig`, `ping`, `tracert`, `nslookup`)  
- Explored **Task Manager**, **Services**, **Event Viewer**, and **MSConfig**  
- Practised Windows Update, restore points, File History, and security tools (Firewall, Defender, UAC)

📸 **Screenshots:**  
All section screenshots are stored under [`Windows_VM/Screenshots`](./Windows_VM/Screenshots) and organised by section:  
- Section 0 – VM Setup  
- Section 1 – User Accounts & Permissions  
- Section 2 – File System & Extensions  
- Section 3 – Control Panel vs Settings  
- Section 4 – Networking Basics  
- Section 5 – System Tools & Utilities  
- Section 6 – Updates & Restore  
- Section 7 – Security
